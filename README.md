### **Color Scheme:**

 The color palette was created using [https://coolors.co/]

![Color Palette]()


I also created this color contrast grid using [https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23000000%2C%20Black%0D%0A%23212529%0D%0A%23FFFFFF%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp), to check the contrast scored and ensure the text remains visible across the entire website and that the site is accessible to everyone.

![Color Contrast Grid]()

### **Typography:**

I decided on using a Google font named Barlow. It features rounded, slightly condensed letterforms with a clean, geometric aesthetic. Barlow’s design is inspired by the visual style of Californian road signs, combining functionality with a friendly, approachable look.

## **Future-Enhancements**


***
## **Testing Phase**

### **Testing During Development**

During the development process, I have been constantly testing the website in the following ways:

1. Manually testing each element of the page for responsiveness and accesibility via a live server opened using GitPod.

2. Published the page via GitHub pages and shared with friends and family to receive feedback.

3. Made use of Developer Tools from different Internet browsers, to continuously identify and troubleshoot any problems I encountered.

#### **Manual Testing**

**Principles:**

1. **Exploratory Testing:** Manual testing is excellent for exploratory testing, where testers actively explore the application to discover unforeseen issues and usability problems.

2. **User Experience (UX) Testing:** Manual testers can assess the application's user-friendliness, usability, and overall user experience, providing valuable insights.

3. **Ad Hoc Testing:** In situations where test cases aren't well-defined or documented, manual testers can perform ad hoc testing to identify issues.

4. **Non-Functional Testing:** Tests related to subjective criteria like aesthetics, layout, and overall look and feel are often better suited for manual testing.

**When to Deploy Manual Testing:**

- **Usability Testing:** To evaluate the user interface and overall user experience.
- **Exploratory Testing:** When new features are introduced or when test cases are not yet well-defined.
- **Complex Test Scenarios:** For intricate and multi-step test cases where human intuition is required.
- **Non-Functional Testing:** Assessing subjective aspects like aesthetics, accessibility, and human factors.

* While testing the website, I have used 4 different browsers to make sure that it is cross-compatible. The desktop browsers I have used for the tesing were:

  - Firefox
  - Google Chrome
  - Microsoft Edge
  - DuckDuckGo

- I have also asked other people to test the website, using their personal iPhones and Macbooks using Safari, since I don't have access to these devices. To which they reported that they have not encountered any bugs.

#### **Automated Testing**

**Principles:**

1. **Repeatability:** Automated tests can be executed repeatedly without any variation in their steps and expected outcomes.

2. **Consistency:** Automated tests perform the same steps and checks each time, eliminating human errors and ensuring consistent results.

3. **Efficiency:** Automated tests can run quickly and efficiently, covering a large number of test cases in a short time.

4. **Regression Testing:** Automated tests are particularly useful for regression testing, where previously tested functionality is retested to ensure that new changes have not introduced defects.

5. **Data-Driven Testing:** Automation allows for data-driven testing, where tests are executed with different sets of data to verify various scenarios.

6. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Automated tests can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, allowing for immediate feedback on code changes and ensuring that only high-quality code is deployed.

**When to Deploy Automated Testing:**

- **Regression Testing:** Automated tests are ideal for regularly checking existing functionality after code changes.
- **Highly Repetitive Tests:** Tasks like data validation, login/logout procedures, and API testing can be automated for efficiency.
- **Load and Performance Testing:** Automated tools can simulate a large number of users to test system performance under heavy loads.
- **Cross-Browser and Cross-Platform Testing:** Automated frameworks can be used to test web applications on different browsers and platforms.

Automated testing can be a powerful tool for catching bugs early on and ensuring that the application is working as expected. While I fully acknowledge the benefits of automated testing and the value it adds to the overall development process, due to time constraints, implementing and maintaining Jest for automated testing was not possible.

#### **User Story Testing**

During my manual testing, I have tested every user story, to ensure that the needs of the users are met.



#### **Functionality testing**


* All the links, buttons and forms work as expected, with no errors.

### **Testing After Development**

#### **Validators**

#### ***HTML*** - <https://validator.w3.org/nu/>

- All pages return no error.

#### ***CSS*** - <https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/>

- All pages tested, no issues found.

![CSS validator badge](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss)

#### ***JSHint*** - <https://jshint.com/>

![JSHint results]()

#### ***Python linter*** - <https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/>

![Python linter results]()

#### **PageSpeed Insights**

- All PageSpeed Insights tests have been made while in incognito mode to avoid any browser extensions interference.
- I have asked several people to run these tests from their own devices as well, and they were getting similar scores.
