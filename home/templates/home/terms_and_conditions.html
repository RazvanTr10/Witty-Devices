        <p>
            Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
            consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states,

            The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and
