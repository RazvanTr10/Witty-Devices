                    and were unsealed after delivery.</li>
                <li>The supply of Goods which are, after delivery, according to their nature, inseparably mixed with

            </ul>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to refuse returns of any merchandise that does not meet the above return conditions
            in our sole discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only regular priced Goods may be refunded. Unfortunately, Goods on sale cannot be refunded. This
            exclusion may not apply to You if it is not permitted by applicable law.
        </p>
        <h2 class="fw-bold">Returning Goods</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            You are responsible for the cost and risk of returning the Goods to Us. You should send the Goods at the
            following address:
        </p>
        <p>10 Smart Way, Leicester, LE56ND United Kingdom</p>
        <p>
            We cannot be held responsible for Goods damaged or lost in return shipment. Therefore, We recommend an
            insured and trackable mail service. We are unable to issue a refund without actual receipt of the Goods
            or proof of received return delivery.
        </p>
        <h2 class="fw-bold">Gifts</h2>
        <p>
            If the Goods were marked as a gift when purchased and then shipped directly to you, You'll receive a gift
            credit for the value of your return. Once the returned product is received, a gift certificate will be
            mailed to You.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the Goods weren't marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the Order shipped to
            themselves to give it to You later, We will send the refund to the gift giver.
